# Password Requirements Validation Demo

## New Feature: Real-time Password Validation with Visual Feedback

The `/reset-password` page now provides **real-time visual feedback** for password requirements as the user types.

### âœ¨ Features Added

#### 1. **Real-time Validation**
- Password requirements are checked **as you type**
- No need to submit the form to see validation feedback

#### 2. **Visual Indicators**
- **Green checkmark âœ“** appears when a requirement is met
- **Gray circle** shows when requirement is not yet met
- **Text color changes** from gray to green when requirement is satisfied

#### 3. **Enhanced Requirements**
The password requirements now include:

1. **âœ“ At least 8 characters long**
2. **âœ“ At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)**
3. **âœ“ At least one lowercase letter (a-z)**
4. **âœ“ At least one number (0-9)**
5. **âœ“ At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)**

### ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

#### User Experience:
1. **Initial State**: All requirements show gray circles
2. **As User Types**: Each requirement that's met shows a green checkmark
3. **Visual Feedback**: Text color changes to green for completed requirements
4. **Form Validation**: Submit button validates all requirements are met

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Real-time validation** using `(ngModelChange)` event
- **RegEx patterns** for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Dynamic CSS classes** for visual feedback
- **Enhanced form validation** that checks all requirements before submission

### ðŸš€ Testing the Feature

To test this feature:

1. **Start the servers:**
   ```bash

   ```

2. **Navigate to the reset password page:**
   - Go to `/profile` (requires login)

3. **Try typing different passwords:**

   - `"Abc123"` - Length, uppercase, lowercase, number met (missing special char)
   - `"Abc123!"` - All requirements met âœ…

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

- **Checkmark Icons**: Beautiful SVG checkmarks in green circles
- **Color Coding**: Green for completed, gray for incomplete

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience by providing immediate, clear feedback about password strength requirements!
